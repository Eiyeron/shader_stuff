# Shady Shader Shack

I fiddle with shaders for three reasons: learning, entertrainment and sometimes projects.

Until I figure a better way to store my experiments and/or gather the ideas and knowledge, I'll make a repo out of them.

But this time, let's do a public one, maybe it'll help someone or allow them to make fun of my bad math or programing skills.

## License

I hastily put a MIT license but I figure this might not work as well you'd expect because of the
snippets I'm taking here and there.
